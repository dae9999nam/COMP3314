# Machine Learning
##### Nowadays, large amount of structured and unstructured data is available.
##### This repository is to understand how ML algorithms work.

## Supervised Learning: Classification vs Regression

### Classification: supervised learning task with discrete class labels
#### Goal: Predict class labels of new instances, based on past observations.
    Binary classification vs Multiclass classification
    
### Regression: Prediction of continuous outcome
#### Goal: Fit a line to it minimizing the distance between sample points and the fitted line

## Reinforcement Learning
### The system (aka agent) improves its performance based on interactions with an environment.
  * Trial-and Error approach
### The agent receives feedback (reward) from the environment.
#### This reward is not the correct ground truth. It is a sample experience.
#### Extensive interaction with the environment allows agent to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward.
